 *                            BEFORE calling the kernel ioctl.
 * - I965_EMIT_TOTAL_STATS gives a filename to which to emit the total
 *                         counts and lengths of GPU commands emitted
 *  - I965_PCI_ID pci_id Give a hexadecimal value of the PCI ID value for
 *                       the GPU the BatchbufferLogger to decode for; this
 *                       value is used if and only if the driver fails to

 *                       use
 *  - I965_DECODE_LEVEL controls the level of batchbuffer decoding
 *     - no_decode do not decode batchbuffer at all
 *     - instruction_decode decode instruction name only
 *     - instruction_details_decode decode instruction contents
 *  - I965_PRINT_RELOC_LEVEL controls at what level to print reloc data
 *     - print_reloc_nothing do not print reloc data
 *     - print_reloc_gem_gpu_updates print reloc data GEM by GEM
 *  - I965_DECODE_SHADERS if set and is 0, shader binaries are written to
 *                        file;  otherwise their disassembly is emitted
 *                        in each session
